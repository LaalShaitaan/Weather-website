#Weather App

This is a website from which you can find the Weather of any place round the globe.
This was built using HTML5, CSS3 and Nodejs.

This was built while taking the Nodejs course from [Andrew Mead](https://mead.io/ "Mead's website").

A couple of API's namely Mapbox and Weatherstack have been used here.

The Front end is very basic as major focus here was to learn how to use and interact with different APIs.
